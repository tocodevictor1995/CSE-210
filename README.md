What is version control and why is it important?

 Version control is like a history of changes for the work we do on the computer, especially when programming or working on projects. It helps keep track of who made what changes, when it happened, and what was altered.
 So, version control is like a super log that tells us all the things that have changed in our projects, so we can understand and go back if needed.
 Version control is important and super useful when multiple people are working on the same project. Imagine if everyone messed with the same file at the same time; it would be a mess. Version control helps avoid that kind of chaos.
 A good place to understand how it works is on GitHub. It might be a bit tricky, but GitHub is a great friend. It's like a super assistant that keeps everything organized. If we want to add a new thing to the project, we can create a "branch" on GitHub for that, keeping things organized and avoiding issues.
 A command we use and will continue to use is "git commit -m "Commit message". This is like telling GitHub: "Hey, I did something, record it for me!" and it saves that change with an explanatory message.
  In summary, version control is a kind of record of what we do on our computer work, like a superpower that helps us collaborate well with others and not get lost in the midst of changes. GitHub is like our assistant that helps us organize everything.
